# Eat-da-Burger Homeowork

This is currently a work in progress assignment, utilizing MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.  Currently, I believe I have the general frameork set up correctly, but am missing a few steps in regards to the handlebars html template. Specifically moving the newly created burger entries between divs WITHOUT using additional jQuery, or sequelize.
